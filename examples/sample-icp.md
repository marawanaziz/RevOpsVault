# Ideal Customer Profile — Nextera Health

## Ideal Customer Characteristics

### Company Profile
- **Industry:** Mid-size hospital systems, regional health networks, multi-site clinics
- **Size:** 200-2,000 beds (or equivalent patient volume for clinic networks)
- **Revenue:** $50M-$500M annual operating revenue
- **Geography:** United States (all regions, with strength in Midwest and Southeast)
- **Stage:** Established institutions undergoing digital transformation

### Technology Signals
- Currently using outdated patient communication methods (phone-only, paper reminders)
- EHR system in place (Epic, Cerner, Meditech) but limited patient-facing digital tools
- Have evaluated or are evaluating patient portal solutions
- IT budget allocated for digital transformation initiatives

### Behavioral Signals
- Attending HIMSS, HLTH, or ViVE conferences
- Published RFPs for patient engagement or communication tools
- Board-level mandate for improving patient satisfaction (HCAHPS scores)
- Recent CIO or VP of Patient Experience hire (signals investment in digital)
- No-show rates above 15% (national average is ~18%, top performers are under 8%)

## Primary Pain Points
- Patient no-show rates costing $200+ per missed appointment
- Low patient satisfaction scores affecting Medicare reimbursement
- Manual appointment reminder processes consuming staff time
- Patients unable to self-schedule or communicate digitally
- Fragmented communication channels (phone, fax, mail) with no unified platform
- Difficulty engaging patients between visits for chronic care management

## Goals & Desired Outcomes
- Reduce no-show rates from 18%+ to under 10%
- Improve HCAHPS patient satisfaction scores by 15-20%
- Automate 80% of appointment reminders (currently manual)
- Launch patient self-scheduling within 6 months
- Unified patient communication dashboard for care coordinators
- Measurable ROI within the first year of implementation

## Decision Process
- **Timeline:** 4-6 months from initial contact to signed contract
- **Buying committee:** VP Patient Experience (champion), CIO (technical approval), CFO (budget), CMO (clinical sign-off)
- **Procurement:** Formal RFP process for deals over $50K ACV; some flexibility for pilot programs
- **Budget cycle:** Typically fiscal year (July-June for most health systems)
- **Proof requirements:** Pilot program with 1-2 departments before enterprise rollout

## Disqualifiers
- Fewer than 100 beds (too small for ROI at our price point)
- No EHR system in place (integration is a prerequisite)
- Health systems in active M&A (decisions stall during mergers)
- Budget under $50K ACV (below our minimum deal size)
- Organizations requiring on-premise deployment (we are cloud-only)
- Critical access hospitals or rural clinics with limited IT infrastructure
