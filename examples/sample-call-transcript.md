**David:** Hey Sarah, thanks for making the time. I know your calendar's been packed. Before we dive in, can you give me a quick picture of where Nextera Health is today from a sales ops perspective?

**Sarah:** Sure. So we're a Series B health tech company, about 80 people now. We sell a patient engagement platform to mid-size hospital systems. Our sales team is 12 reps, and we just hit $8M ARR last quarter. The problem is we're trying to get to $15M by end of year and our current process just won't scale.

**David:** What's breaking first?

**Sarah:** Lead routing, honestly. We use HubSpot but it's a mess. Leads come in from the website, from conferences, from partner referrals — and they all land in the same queue. Our SDRs are supposed to triage but half the time a lead sits for two or three days before anyone touches it. We measured it last month — average response time was 47 hours. For inbound leads. That's killing us.

**David:** 47 hours — yeah, that's a conversion killer. What's causing the delay? Is it a process issue or a tooling issue?

**Sarah:** Both. The routing rules in HubSpot are basically nonexistent. We set up some basic assignment rules a year ago when we had 4 reps and never updated them. Now we have 12 reps across three territories and the rules don't account for territory, deal size, or segment. Plus our SDRs don't have a clear SLA. There's no alerting, no escalation. A lead can sit in the queue and nobody knows.

**David:** Makes sense. What about the handoff from SDR to AE? How does that work?

**Sarah:** Badly. The SDR qualifies the lead — sort of — and then manually reassigns it in HubSpot with a note. But the notes are inconsistent, sometimes there's no context, and the AE has to re-discover half of what the SDR already learned. We're basically running discovery twice on every deal.

**David:** Have you looked at any solutions for this? Automation tools, or hiring someone to fix it?

**Sarah:** We talked to a couple of agencies but they were pure implementation — they'd configure HubSpot but they couldn't tell us what the process SHOULD be. We need someone who can design the workflow and then build it. I don't want to pay someone to automate a broken process.

**David:** That's exactly the right instinct. What about budget? Has leadership allocated anything for fixing this?

**Sarah:** Our CEO approved a $10K-15K per month budget for RevOps support. He's seen the lead response numbers and he's frustrated. The board is pushing on it too — they want to see a clear path to $15M and they know ops is the bottleneck.

**David:** That's helpful context. And timeline — is there urgency, or is this a "when we get to it" thing?

**Sarah:** We want to start within the next 3-4 weeks. Q2 is our biggest quarter for hospital system buying cycles and we cannot go into it with the current setup. If we don't fix lead routing and handoffs by April, we're going to miss pipeline targets.

**David:** Got it. One more question — who else would be involved in evaluating this? Is this your decision or does it go through a committee?

**Sarah:** It's primarily my decision with CEO sign-off. He's already bought in on the budget. I'd want our Head of SDRs, Marcus Johnson, to weigh in on the process side since he'll be living with whatever we build. But the decision is mine.

**David:** Perfect. Here's what I'm thinking for next steps. Let me put together a scoping document that covers what a first-month engagement would look like — lead routing redesign, HubSpot configuration, SDR handoff process, and SLA framework. Can we schedule a follow-up for Thursday to walk through it?

**Sarah:** Thursday works. Morning is better — maybe 10am Pacific?

**David:** Done. I'll send a calendar invite today. One last thing — is there a competitor or existing tool you're evaluating alongside us? Just want to make sure I'm addressing the right things in the scoping doc.

**Sarah:** We had a conversation with Go Nimbly a few weeks ago. They seemed solid but more focused on the technical side. We need the strategic layer too — someone who can tell us what good looks like for a company at our stage, not just configure the tools.

**David:** Understood. That's a core part of how we work — the 50/50 strategy plus implementation model. I'll make sure the scoping doc reflects that. Thanks Sarah, talk Thursday.

**Sarah:** Sounds good. Thanks David.
