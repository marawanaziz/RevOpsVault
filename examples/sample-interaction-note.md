## Raw Transcript
_Q1 QBR conducted via Zoom. Notes captured in real-time._

David: Thanks for joining, Sarah and Lisa. Let's start with a review of the key metrics since onboarding.

Sarah: Sure. The numbers have been great honestly. Our no-show rate was at 18% before we started and we're down to 11% now. That's huge for us — each missed appointment costs us over $200 in lost revenue and rescheduling overhead.

Lisa: From the patient experience side, we're seeing really positive feedback. The self-scheduling feature has been the biggest win. Patients love being able to book and reschedule online instead of calling.

David: That's great to hear. Adoption is at 78% across your three hospital systems. We're targeting 80% by end of Q1 — are there any blockers to getting there?

Lisa: The main thing is the SMS delivery in our rural locations. We're seeing about 92% delivery rates there vs. 99% in metro areas. It's not a dealbreaker but some patients in those areas are still relying on phone calls.

Sarah: Speaking of next steps — Lisa and I have been talking about the analytics module. We need better board-level reporting on patient engagement metrics. Can we get a demo?

David: Absolutely. I'll set that up this week. Anything else on the roadmap that's interesting to you?

Sarah: Also — I presented your solution at HIMSS last month and got a lot of interest. Would you want me to be a formal reference customer? Happy to do that.
