# Campaign: LinkedIn Paid — VP Engineering Health Systems

## Overview
Paid LinkedIn campaign targeting VP/Director of Engineering at mid-size hospital systems (200-2,000 beds). Goal is to generate 15 MQLs in 30 days by promoting our platform integration whitepaper and driving demo requests. This is our first paid campaign specifically targeting the technical evaluator persona.

## Audience & Targeting
- **Target Persona:** VP/Director of Engineering at hospital systems
- **Segment:** Mid-size health systems, 200-2,000 beds, US-based
- **Exclusions:** Current customers, competitors, health systems under 100 beds
- **LinkedIn targeting:** Job title (VP Engineering, Director of IT, CTO) + Industry (Hospital & Health Care) + Company size (500-10,000)

## Messaging & Creative
- **Primary message:** "Your EHR integration shouldn't take 6 months. See how leading health systems connect patient engagement in weeks, not quarters."
- **CTA:** Download whitepaper → Demo request follow-up sequence
- **Assets:** Whitepaper PDF, 3 ad variations (carousel, single image, video testimonial), landing page

## Key Learnings
- Carousel ad format outperforms single image by 2.3x CTR (1.2% vs 0.52%)
- "Integration speed" messaging resonates more than "cost savings" — hypothesis validated
- VP Engineering title targeting generates higher quality leads than Director of IT
- Weekend ad delivery has 40% lower CPL than weekday — adjusting schedule
- Video testimonial ad has highest engagement but lowest conversion — good for brand, not direct response
